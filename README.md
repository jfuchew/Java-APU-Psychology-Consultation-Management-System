ðŸ§± Object-Oriented Concepts Applied
Encapsulation: Data is wrapped within classes like User, Student, Lecturer, Appointment, and Feedback.

Inheritance: Student and Lecturer classes inherit from a base User class.

Polymorphism: Overridden methods for displaying appointments and handling consultation logic.

Abstraction: Use of classes and methods to simplify user operations.
